#
# Yet another Dynamic IP controller - Script to execute
# commands/actions upon WAN IP changes.
#
# Author:	Th. Walrant <yadynip.tgc@walrant.net>
# Date:		May 2014
#
# Detection:

# The tool accepts multiple ways to detect the WAN IP address by
# executing different checkip scripts until an IP address is found
# (See the checkip.d folder for examples of available
# methods/scripts). You can add your own method and/or disable some
# scripts by deleting the script file or by updating the script to
# return/exit without returning an IP address.
#
# Actions:
#
# Once the IP address is detected, the tool check all available
# actions (located in folder actions.d). It executes the action script
# only if the IP address has changed. The IP address is cached per
# action upon succesfull execution of the action, so that the tool is
# able to only repeat the action who failed at the previous attempt.
